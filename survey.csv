Though, It's perhaps not as unique as it once was as I see many public markets in various towns now.  As a society, we are a little more disconnected from the heritage that made some of the vendors so special to visit.

West Side Market, while there are some good vendors, I could be anywhere.  Nothing there really screams that I am in Cleveland.  For example, in Grand Rapids, there are vendors with hand towels with the state of Michigan, another with an ice cream on a stick in the shape of Michigan.

Also Pike Place smells more strongly of fish. Pike Place has an underground knick knack/oddities section (unlike Westside), a groceries section like Westside, a restaurant area like Westside, and a crafts section (unlike Westside). The variety at Pike Place makes it feel like it’s catered to tourists rather than for the people of Seattle. At Westside, there are definitely tourists, but also people like me do their regular grocery shopping there because it’s a one stop shop for fresh stuff (I trust the butchers there more than the supermarket, the vegetables on the corner stall are cheap, and the cheese sellers have a great variety, and I can get good FRESH baked bread). If Westside spread itself too thin like Pike Place, expanding into knick knacks/oddities/regular shops it would no longer feel like a place where I could go grocery shopping. Plus it would lose some of its history I think—becoming “over produced.” One thing Pike Place has going for it — great views and great seating, so you can grab a snack and sit to stay a while. The tiny balcony at Westside is FANTASTIC, but when the weather is bad and you can’t go across the street to the park, it is packed. Plus, no tables makes it more difficult to enjoy the delicious snacks I’ve picked up at the market (it’s usually a grocery shopping + snack/meal trip, because there are so many good ready-made food stalls at Westside—-this is unique from a regular grocery shopping trip for me where I usually go ONLY for groceries). 

I usually entice a friend to go with me to Westside by convincing them to try the peruvian purple potato cake (with goat cheese filling) at Orale, but they often wander away and try their own thing. This is the beauty of the market! But the options can be overwhelming. It might be good to have some specific items at specific stands that really are the stars—the multitude of choices can be overwhelming to first-timers. Having maybe 4 products that are really “famous” that people want to try/check off the bucket list — potentially one at each corner of the market to encourage people to explore the whole market along the way — could help first-timers find their footing better, preventing overwhelm.","2,3,5,6,7",,"3,11",,1,1,,2,3,1,1,3,3,2,1,"Sometimes there is a busker playing music on the balcony and that always adds a great ambiance. Happy hours/cocktail events would be super fun. 

Note about hours: I think it’s good to be open on Mondays, even if it’s slower, because lots of other attractions in the city are closed on Mondays. Always inconvenient for showing guests around the city on a Monday and everything is closed. ",8,2,"Westside market vendors are always busy. It’s usually a fast interaction with little chit chat which poses no issue for me. ","My go to’s for ready-made food: Ohio city pasta (expensive, but worth it. Their corn tarragon sauce is amazing)
The irish bakery that sells shepherd’s pies 
Orale for peruvian purple potato cakes
One lady who sells apple fritters sometimes (she’s great but she’s only sometimes there and doesn’t really have a sign haha)

It’s pretty neat to see Cleveland’s immigrant dynamics on display at the Market via the food being sold ","The market is super lucky to be on the Red Line. It can’t get any more publically accessible, but the distance is still a barrier to going more frequently. The cheap parking in the back is fantastic, though, because it’s hard to park in that neighborhood! ",4,4,3,4,4,3,2,2,1,2,4,4,2,4,"3,9,10,12","Posters ",1,1,2,2,margauxjohnstone@gmail.com,1,xlab

Also the stands are set up for diversity but don’t make sense when you are trying to shop for multiple things.

More quantity discount pricing could help.","I think it can feel overly crowded. Re-arranging the stalls, if possible, for more space between would accommodate more customers and feel more open. Put recipes and recipe videos in your social marketing, feature local chefs shopping in the market and then cooking the recipe. Weekly/monthly features on local TV. Are there any local food influencers? Partner with Sur La Tab and other cooking schools in region. Weirdly enough, I have had success with something very basic- posters in daycare centers. You have to get the moms/parents. And Pinterest should definitely be on your social media. (sorry, I'm not familiar with the social media you do already). What about Head Start? Can you do something with them? Sur La Tab will get you the high end of the spectrum but Head Start will get you another one. Every vendor should be handing out free recipes. Maybe a QR code on every package that leads to the market's website and the recipes are there. More coupons for repeat sales and quantity sales. More handicap parking close to the building. Maybe market staff in bright blue vests walking around and the vest says ""Need Help? Ask Me."" Help older people/handicap to their cars with their groceries.

Especially with the construction forcing everyone walking from the parking lot to pass through the entirety of the Arcade, it feels like a gauntlet where you get bombarded by every vendor when you're just trying to get through to go to the main Market building (where I've often considered just walking around the block outside to avoid this, if I'm not shopping for produce that day).

Doorways in the produce Arcade leading towards the main Market are also always congested, with the walkways to the double-doors being very narrow due to the produce stands overhanging into that aisle, so it can only be single-file to get in or out, which often leads to waiting for a line of people to get through that area before you can enter or exit.  This was occurring before construction started as well.  Only made worse when shoppers are also standing in that walkway looking at produce.
